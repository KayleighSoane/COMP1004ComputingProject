Process notes

Created html, css and js files
First focussed on designing ui
Created sections on html to plan what ill need before coding
Created sections for each box on page
Formatted so that they were next to eachother - process called flexbox

Came up with more ideas:
language selectors would have to be dropdown menus
Could make page navigation bar to an about page, help page etc
If text is too long, scroll down within box or make text smaller to fit
Want to have initial text in boxes that is replaced once user types stuff

Basic dropdowns created - for now, doesn't need to be complicated.
For future - will have to link translation language to dropdown selection.
In future, could make code that if input is detected as English, automatically changes to English

Basic UI created, next need to code user input within textbox that replaces existing text
