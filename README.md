I have decided to make a translator. Translation tools are important in connecting people from all over the world to be able to build relationships and share knowledge.

Users will be able to input text in one box. The input language will be automatically detected or the user can manually select it. In a box adjacent, the user will be able to select the output language which will be displayed after the user has finished typing. The output will be displayed as grammatically and contextually correct in that language. The translation will be able to be copied to the clipboard.
